# Docsify Themeable Template

> A Docsify Themeable template that requires no build steps.

## Setup

Want to get going quickly using just GitHub Pages? Tap the green "Use this template" button in the upper-right of this GitHub Repository, then once you have created your own Repostitory go to **Settings -> Pages** and under **Branch** choose **main** and then tap **Save**. Wait a minute or two and refresh this page - a link to view the resulting GitHub Pages site should then be displayed.

Alternatively, upload the files to any static web server. Or run `npx serve .` (Node.js users) or `python -m http.server 8000` (Python users) in the repo to serve run locally.
