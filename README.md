# Docsify Themeable Template

> A [Docsify](https://github.com/docsifyjs/docsify/) template for Markdown-based documentation sites, , with no build process required. Includes the theme system [Docsify Themeable](https://github.com/jhildenbiddle/docsify-themeable).

## Setup

The quickest way to get a Docsify site up and running is with GitHub Pages:  

1. Log into GitHub if you have not done so already
2. Tap the **Use this template** button in the upper-right of this GitHub Repository and choose **Create a new repository**
3. Enter a name for your new Repository and then tap the **Create repository** button
4. Once your new Repostitory is created go to **Settings**, then select **Pages** from the left-hand sidebar, and under **Branch** choose **main** and then tap the **Save** button
5. Wait a minute or two and refresh this page - a link to view the resulting GitHub Pages site should then be displayed

Alternatively, upload the files to any static web server. Or run `npx serve .` (Node.js users) or `python -m http.server 8000` (Python users) in the repo to serve run locally.

## Editing Content

How about editing the content of your new Docsify site? All you need to do is edit the source Markdown page **README.md** by viewing that page, taping the pencil (edit) icon, saving any changes by taping the green **Commit changes...** button, and in just a few moments the Docsify site will be automatically updated to reflect those changes!
