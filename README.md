# Docsify Themeable Template

> A [Docsify](https://github.com/docsifyjs/docsify/) template, that requires no build process, including the theme system [Docsify Themeable](https://github.com/jhildenbiddle/docsify-themeable).

## Setup

Want to get going quickly using just GitHub Pages? Once logged into GitHub tap the green **Use this template** button in the upper-right of this GitHub Repository, choose **Create a new repository**, then once you have created your own Repostitory go to **Settings -> Pages** and under **Branch** choose **main** and then tap **Save**. Wait a minute or two and refresh this page - a link to view the resulting GitHub Pages site should then be displayed.

Alternatively, upload the files to any static web server. Or run `npx serve .` (Node.js users) or `python -m http.server 8000` (Python users) in the repo to serve run locally.

## Editing Content

How about editing the content of your new Docsify site? All you need to do is edit the source Markdown page **README.md** by viewing that page, taping the pencil (edit) icon, saving any changes by taping the green **Commit changes...** button, and in just a few moments the Docsify site will be automatically updated to reflect those changes!
